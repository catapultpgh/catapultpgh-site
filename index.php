		<h2>Why cowork?</h2>
		<p class="summary">Sure, maybe you've got an extra bedroom for your home office, or maybe you are perfectly happy working from your local coffee shop. Same here! But guess what? Coworking <em>works</em>, and here's why:</p>
		<div class="clearfix">
			<div class="sixcol first">
				<h5>Network</h5>
				<p>Are you a writer looking for work? Need a web designer? Well, talk to the designer next to you! Or post to our Google Group that you are a writer looking for work, and chances are someone in the space will send you a referral.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sixcol last">
				<h5>Productivity</h5>
				<p>According to surveys, coworkers report being <strong>75% more productive</strong> than in their previous work spaces. With no kids, TV, or cleaning to be done, you can focus on what you need to do. And, of course, participate in some productive banter along the way.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="clearfix">
			<div class="sixcol first">
				<h5>Legit Meeting Space</h5>
				<p>You can't meet with clients in your living room, and coffee shops have sub-par internet, no projector or whiteboards, and are noisy! Wouldn't it be awesome to have all of these things and swanky conference room? Plus friendly faces all over the place.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sixcol last">
				<h5>Take yourself seriously</h5>
				<p>Let's face it. Working in your underwear is <em>way</em> overrated. You are better than that!</p>

		<h2>What Catapult Isn't</h2>
		<p class="summary">Just to clarify:</p>
		<div class="clearfix">
			<div class="sixcol first">
				<h5>An incubator</h5>
				<p>Of course, we welcome startups with opening arms. But unlike other coworking spaces in Pittsburgh, Catapult does not double as an incubator. We are simply a community of independents who choose to work together.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sixcol last">
				<h5>Boring Office Space</h5>
				<p>We do have a few offices to rent, but we aren't an office space. Offices are <a href="http://www.deskmag.com/en/advantages-of-coworkig-spaces-over-traditional-and-home-offices-581" taget="blank">boring, antisocial, and suffocating</a> - the antithesis of coworking. We do have some cubicles around for fun though. Feel free to vandalize them.</p>

		<h2>Community</h2>
		<blockquote class="h2">“Our no. 1 resource isn’t our square footage, it’s the relationships and connections between our members.” - <cite>Alex Hillman, founder of Indy Hall</cite></blockquote>
		<p>That quote says it all. Sure, a conference room, fast internet, and coffee are all valid reasons to join a coworking space, but at the end of the day it's the people. In addition to the day-to-day banter and chit-chat, Catapult hosts various events via Meetup.com and has many connections throughout the wider Pittsburgh community. Have an idea for an event yourself? Let us know.</p>
