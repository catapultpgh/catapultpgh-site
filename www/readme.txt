A boilerplate for custom websites, created by Lara! It's annoying to have to keep putting together tools you use for every website. As I'm sure many designers do, I have made myself a starter kit that includes everything I use to start a site. Maybe other people would be interested, so here it is! Of course, this version will be better documented as time goes on.

In sum:
This is a hybrid of Intializr and the style conventions used in the WP theme Bones.
SASS only.

Other tools included:

font awesome, the icon font:

animate.css:
